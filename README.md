# nextjs-swiper-demo

This is a Swiper demo run on next.js, intended to show how to use Swiper Element(Web components) in React.

Noted: Currently, Swiper Element is only supported in CSR mode, so we use `Client Components` to render the Swiper Element.

## Prerequisites

Run `pnpm install` to install the dependencies.

## Running commands

Development mode: The webstie will be hot updated once source file is changed.

```shell
pnpm dev
```

Production mode: The webstie will be first built and be served on a server process.

```shell
pnpm build
pnpm start
```
